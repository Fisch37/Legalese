# Legalese
Did you ever want to rename your favourite item to the complete works of Sherlock Holmes but were unjustly stumped by the anvil character limit? No more! I have removed this oppressive symbol of the surveillance state so you can finally name your things however long you like!*


_*Note: Copying the entire works of Sherlock Holmes into your anvil may lead to unforeseen behaviour up to and including game crashes or world corruption. I take no responsibility should you install this mod and discover your world rendered permanently weird_
